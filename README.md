## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or any other relational database, modify Prisma schema accordingly)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Install project dependencies using npm:
npm install

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

Create a .env file in the root of the project and configure your environment variables:

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"

Replace the DATABASE_URL with your actual PostgreSQL connection string, and provide a strong secret for JWT_SECRET.

4. **Run Database Migrations:**

Use Prisma to generate the necessary database tables:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init

5. **Start the Development Server:**

Start the Next.js development server:

    npm run dev

  - **Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.**

**Basic Functions Used**
1. Home Page:

    Displays a list of all available job postings fetched from the API (/api/jobs).

    Users can search jobs by job type (Full-Time, Part-Time, Contract, All) and by location.

2. JWT Authentication:

    Implements a JWT-based authentication system.

    Users can log in and register by providing their email and password.

    Upon successful login, a JWT is stored in the browserâ€™s session for session management.

3. Login & Register:

    Users can register with an email and password, and they receive a JWT token.

    After registration or login, users are redirected to their dashboard page.

    The JWT token is stored in the session to maintain the user's login state.

4. Dashboard (Authenticated Users):

    Add Job: Authenticated users can add new job postings via the dashboard.

    View Jobs: Users can view the list of jobs they've posted.

    Delete Job: Users can delete jobs they have posted from their dashboard.

5. Sign Out:

    A sign-out button allows users to log out of their session, which invalidates their JWT token.
